\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In this section, you should introduce the reader to the problem you
are attempting to solve. For example, for the first project: describe
the $15$-puzzle, and why it's interesting as an A.I. problem. You
should also cite and briefly describe other related papers that have
tackled this problem in the past --- things that came up during the
course of your research. In the AAAI style, citations look like
\cite{aima} (see the comments in the source file \texttt{intro.tex} to
see how this citation was produced). Conclude by summarizing how the
remainder of the paper is organized. \\

% Citations: As you can see above, you create a citation by using the
% \cite{} command. Inside the braces, you provide a "key" that is
% uniue to the paper/book/resource you are citing. How do you
% associate a key with a specific paper? You do so in a separate bib
% file --- for this document, the bib file is called
% project1.bib. Open that file to continue reading...

% Note that merely hitting the "return" key will not start a new line
% in LaTeX. To break a line, you need to end it with \\. To begin a 
% new paragraph, end a line with \\, leave a blank
% line, and then start the next line (like in this example).
Overall, the aim in this section is context-setting: what is the
big-picture surrounding the problem you are tackling here?
