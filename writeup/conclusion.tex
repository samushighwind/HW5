\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}

We sought to study the exploration-exploitation problem in reinforcement
learning through analysis of the multi-armed bandit problem. Following prior
research, we have been able to show that the $\mathcal{E}_n$-\textlcsc{greedy}
policy consistently (with low $c$ value) outperforms the \textlcsc{UCB1} policy.

Our choice of $d$ values in our experiment unquestioningly mirrored those
chosen in the prior piece of research we followed. Further research should investigate
experimental differences resulting from different values for $d$.
