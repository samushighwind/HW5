\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Present the results of your experiments. Simply presenting the data is
insufficient! You need to analyze your results. What did you discover?
What is interesting about your results? Were the results what you
expected? Use appropriate visualizations. Prefer graphs and charts to
tables as they are easier to read (though tables are often more
compact, and can be a better choice if you're squeezed for space).
\textbf{Always} include information that conveys the uncertainty in
your measurements: mean statistics should be plotted with error bars,
or reported in tables with a $\pm$ range. The $95\%$-confidence
interval is a commonly reported statistic.

\subsection{Embedding Pictures}
\label{subsec:pics}

See the source code (\texttt{results.tex}) for instructions on how to
insert figures (like figure~\ref{fig:tex}) or plots into your
document.

% Note that TeX has a mind of its own when it comes to placing images
% in documents - where a figure appears in the PDF document will often
% be quite different from where it appears in the source code. This is
% a feature, not a bug - it enables LaTeX to produce layouts that
% "flow" better. It only takes a few lines to insert a figure into
% your write-up - I recommend using PNG, JPG or PDF images
% (incidentally, programs like Excel and Matlab will allow you to save
% any plots or figures you generate in those formats). The \figure{}
% command is used to create a new figure.
\begin{figure}[htb]

  \centering  % centers the image in the column

  % replace the second argument below with your filename. I like to
  % place all my figures in a sub-directory to keep things organized
  \includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{figs/file_extensions.png}

  % *Every* figure should have a descriptive caption.
  \caption{On the trustworthiness of \LaTeX. Image courtesy of \texttt{xkcd}.}

  % The label is a handle you create so that you can refer to this
  % figure (using the \ref{} command) from other parts of your
  % document. LaTeX automatically renumbers figures and updates
  % references when you recompile, so you should do it this way rather
  % than hard-coding in references. Notice that I've also been
  % creating labels for the various sections in the document; I could
  % use \ref{} command to refer to those sections using their labels
  % too.

\subsection{Creating Tables}
\label{subsec:tables}

Again, refer to \texttt{results.tex} to learn how to create simple
tables (like table~\ref{tab:example}).
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering % centers the entire table

  % The following line sets the parameters of the table: we'll have
  % three columns (one per 'c'), each
  % column will be centered (hence the 'c'; 'l' or 'r' will left or
  % right justify the column) and the columns
  % will have lines between them (that's the purpose of the |s between
  % the 'c's).
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} 
    \hline \hline % draws two horizontal lines at the top of the table
    Column 1 & Column 2 & Column 3 \\ % separate column contents using the &
    \hline % line after the column headers
    $1$ & $3.1$ & $2.7$ \\
    $42$ & $-1$ & $1729$\\
    \hline \hline
  \end{tabular}

  % As with figures, *every* table should have a descriptive caption
  % and a label for ease of reference.
  \caption{An example table.}
  \label{tab:example}

\end{figure}
