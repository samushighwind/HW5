\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

When faced with multiple options in a situation, naturally one does
not know whether to explore more options or stick to the best option
that one knows. A multi-armed bandit problem enables us to study the
exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning. This
problem is interesting to Artificial Intelligence researchers due to
the number of interesting practical uses that it has been applied
to. For example, the multi-armed bandit problem has been used to model
clinical trial treatments, ad placement, website optimization, and 
computer game-playing \cite{bubeck}.

The multi-armed bandit problem has been analyzed extensively
\cite{auer}, and this paper attempts to reproduce a subset of this
work. The remainder of this paper includes background information on
reinforcement learning and the multi-armed bandit problem, the
experiments we performed, the results, and finally our conclusions.


In this section, you should introduce the reader to the problem you
are attempting to solve. For example, for the first project: describe
the $15$-puzzle, and why it's interesting as an A.I. problem. You
should also cite and briefly describe other related papers that have
tackled this problem in the past --- things that came up during the
course of your research. In the AAAI style, citations look like
\cite{aima} (see the comments in the source file \texttt{intro.tex} to
see how this citation was produced). Conclude by summarizing how the
remainder of the paper is organized.\\

% Citations: As you can see above, you create a citation by using the
% \cite{} command. Inside the braces, you provide a "key" that is
% uniue to the paper/book/resource you are citing. How do you
% associate a key with a specific paper? You do so in a separate bib
% file --- for this document, the bib file is called
% project1.bib. Open that file to continue reading...

% Note that merely hitting the "return" key will not start a new line
% in LaTeX. To break a line, you need to end it with \\. To begin a 
% new paragraph, end a line with \\, leave a blank
% line, and then start the next line (like in this example).
Overall, the aim in this section is context-setting: what is the
big-picture surrounding the problem you are tackling here?
