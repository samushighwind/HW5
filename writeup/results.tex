Our results are summarized in Figures 1---8 in the appendix
section. For each distribution, we graphed the \% of the time that the
best machine was picked, as well as the regret on a logarithmic x-axis
of the number of plays.

For all experiments, the $\mathcal{E}_n$-\textlcsc{greedy} policy
outperformed the \textlcsc{UCB1} policy. This was measured by the fact
that the $\mathcal{E}_n$-\textlcsc{greedy} policies converged to the
best policy quicker than the \textlcsc{UCB1} policy, and that the
\textlcsc{UCB1} policy had a much higher regret than the other
policies. Furthermore, it appears that higher values of the parameter
$c$ result in worse performing policies judging by regret, however
they did not differ greatly.
